# shoulder-instability-osteroarthritis
RNA-seq study of shoulder tissue.

## Study design

We have RNA-seq and cytokine data from different groups of patients.
The contrasts required are detailed below:

### Osteoarthritis group

Questions:

1. What is the relationship between metabolic syndrome (visceral obesity, 
hypertension, elevated fasting glucose, and dyslipidaemia) and the
transcriptomic profile of shoulder OA when comparing bone biopsies 
between patients with cuff arthropathy and primary osteoarthritis?
For the above analyses to be effective, we will need to adjust for
age, sex and CRP.
Patients are classified as having metabolic syndrome = YES, or not = No,
giving us a discrete variable which takes into account BMI, 
Fasting glucose, Cholesterol and Blood pressure in accordance with
the international diabetes federation definition. 

Metabolic syndrome: N = 9 patients (all in the primary OA/cuff arthropathy group)

Primary OA: N = 13 patients

Cuff arthropathy: N = 7 patients

Instability (control group): N = 26


2. Can we predict gene expression profile in capsular tissue biopsies
of patients undergoing shoulder stabilisation for shoulder instability
using capsular tissue biopsies in patients with cuff arthropathy and
primary osteoarthritis?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is a cross tissue expression analysis to predict 
gene expression profiles in the instability group?
In doing so I assume if we cannot predict gene expression profiles in the instability
group â€“ this suggests the differences are disease specific (OA/Cuff arthropathy)?

### Rotator cuff group

1. Can we predict the gene expression profile in capsular tissue biopsies
of patients undergoing rotator cuff repair using capsular tissue biopsies
in patients undergoing shoulder replacement for primary OA or Rotator cuff
arthropathy? (adjusting for age and sex also).

2. To investigate if there is a unique transcriptomic expression profile
that predicts healing or failure to heal in patients undergoing rotator cuff
repair by analysing tear edge tissue biopsies, compared to instability as a
control group (capsular tissue).
